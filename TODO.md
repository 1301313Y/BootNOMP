Todo list

Order is priority

(!) Block Explorer
    - Immature blocks / Confirmation count
    - Value of blocks in dataTable (BTC Value at mining) [ Leshacat: Needs more stats data... ]

( ) More statistics 
    - BTC Value of block at time of mining
    - Average blocks per day, week, month for each coin
    - Average time to find block
    
(?) Fix neoscrypt (Almost ready) [ LeshaCat: Is this not working? I am mining it lol ] 

(!) Rewrite payments module + tests [ LeshaCat: Currently looking at this module... (not rewrite, just add features) ]

( ) Add option to make an manual payments rather than automatic (for pools with big network diff) [ LeshaCat: Will put control in Admin Panel that uses RPC call ]

( ) New frontend [ LeshaCat: Does not do Graphics. Only functionality and minor visual improvements. ]

( ) Move modules in one project [ LeshaCat: You take this one too ]

(?) Write different log level at one time [ LeshaCat: Clarification please...? ]

( ) Documentation [ LeshaCat: Can do this too... ]

( ) MySQL/MariaDB/MongoDB options (one or all) as replacement for Redis ? [ LeshaCat: Can't do this either :( ]

If you are OK with it I can knock a bit off this list, and you could handle graphics/modules/init.js and code I can't figure out

Also I don't care to learn Redis, so adding new statistics or database options you will need to do.

I have many other ideas but not going to list here.

LeshaCat Current focus: Block Explorer.
