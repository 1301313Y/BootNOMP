Todo list

Order is priority
(?) Fix neoscrypt (Almost ready) [ LeshaCat: Is this not working? I am mining it lol ] 
(!) Rewrite payments module + tests [ LeshaCat: Currently looking at this module... ]
( ) Add option to make an manual payments rather than automatic (for pools with big network diff) [ LeshaCat: Will put control in Admin Panel that uses RPC call ]
( ) New frontend [ LeshaCat: Does not do Graphics. Only functionality and minor visual improvements. ]
( ) Move modules in one project [ LeshaCat: You take this one too ]
(?) Write different log level at one time [ LeshaCat: Clarification please...? ]
( ) Documentation [ LeshaCat: Can do this too... ]
( ) MySQL/MariaDB/MongoDB options (one or all) as replacement for Redis ? [ LeshaCat: Can't do this either :( ]

If you are OK with it I can knock a bit off this list, and you could handle graphics/modules/init.js and code I can't figure out

Also I don't care to learn Redis, so adding new statistics you will need to do.

I have many other ideas but not going to list here.
