If you are OK with it I can knock a bit off this list, and you could handle graphics/modules/init.js and code I can't figure out

Also I don't care to learn Redis, so adding new statistics or database options you will need to do.

I have many other ideas but not going to list here.

LeshaCat Current focus: Block Explorer.
